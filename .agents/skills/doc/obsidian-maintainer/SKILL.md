## Task preconditions

You MUST NOT generate or edit a note if even one of the preconditions is not met.

### Decide whether this task actually warrants a note

Ask explicitly: *Has this task taught me something that a future session would have to rediscover?* A note is owed if any of these triggers applied during the task:

- Reading or searching through several files was needed to answer **a single** question.
- Documentation, a comment, or an existing note turned out to be incorrect or out of date.
- A boundary condition, invariant, or limit surfaced that wasn't documented anywhere.
- One approach was chosen over another, and the reason is worth remembering.
- A pitfall, unexpected behavior, or a non-obvious dependency was encountered.
- History had to be reconstructed (why something was removed, renamed, or replaced).

If none of these apply — the task was routine and nothing here would need rediscovering — do not create or edit a note; report "no note warranted" and stop. This applies whether the request explicitly asked for a note or this skill was invoked generically at the end of a task.

### Check the content actually belongs in the graph

`obsidian/AGENTS.md` is a directory-level agent-instructions file, not a knowledge note.

Only the following kinds of content belong in `obsidian/` — if what triggered the note above doesn't fit one of these, it belongs in a different artifact instead, not here:

- Subject-specific rules, invariants, and lifecycles that do not stem from a single file.
- Technical limitations and constraints: what **must not** be done, and why.
- Non-obvious pitfalls, error scenarios, and special cases.
- Conventions.

### Identify target note and category

`obsidian/AGENTS.md` is exempt from the frontmatter, category, and MOC-linkage rules below.

Extract the note's topic and one of the allowed categories from the request.
Check that the category is an existing directory — do not create a new category without explicit approval.
Replace placeholder `{category}` and `{topic}` accordingly; the file is `obsidian/{category}/{topic}.md`.

### Verify the claim against the code

Before writing or editing the note's content, locate the code it will describe and read it. Every note is a hypothesis about the code, never an independent fact — never write a note's factual claim from memory or assumption.

## Task steps

### Add the note to its category's MOC in the same change

Every category has a map of contents at `obsidian/{category}/moc.md`, linked from the vault index `obsidian/index.md`. In the same change that creates a note (or substantially changes what it's about), add or update a one-line entry for it in that `moc.md`: a concise link plus a short description — never a copy of the note's content. Do not create a new `moc.md`; one already exists per category. A note is not done until it is reachable from its category's MOC.

### Write or update the note body

State the fact/pattern/rationale concisely — one fact per note, small and atomic. Use standard Markdown links only (no `[[wikilinks]]`). Never restate `openspec/` content — link to it instead.

### Set frontmatter

```yaml
---
category: {category}
related:
  - {relative link to a related note}
status: current
updated: {today's date}
---
```

### Resolve a contradiction, if the note already existed and disagreed with the code

Follow the code. Correct the note's body and set `updated:` to today. If verification isn't possible (the agent can't read/run the relevant code, or the answer is genuinely ambiguous), set `status: stale` and add a one-line explanation of why — do not guess.

### Never treat a stale or superseded note as current guidance

If this task encounters a note already marked `status: stale` or `status: superseded` while writing a *different* note, do not cite its content as if it were verified — go check the code (or a more authoritative artifact per the precedence order) instead.

## Validation checklist

- [ ] At least one rediscovery trigger actually applied — a note was not written just because this skill was invoked
- [ ] The note's content is one of: subject rules/invariants/lifecycles not tied to a single file, technical must-not constraints, a decision (incl. rejected alternatives), a non-obvious pitfall/error scenario, or a convention
- [ ] Frontmatter has `category`, `related`, `status`, and `updated:` (not applicable to `obsidian/AGENTS.md`, which is exempt)
- [ ] `category` is one of the existing categories
- [ ] The note is linked from its category's `moc.md`, added in this same change
- [ ] Every link is standard Markdown, no `[[wikilinks]]`
- [ ] The note does not restate `openspec/` content
- [ ] No file under `pages/` is referenced from the note
- [ ] No file under `plans/` is referenced from the note
- [ ] Every factual claim was checked against the code (or the more authoritative artifact) before writing, per the §1.1 precedence order
- [ ] A note that couldn't be verified is `status: stale` with a one-line reason, not a guess presented as fact

## Task output

If no trigger applied: report "no note warranted" and nothing else. Otherwise report the note's path, its `status`, which trigger(s) prompted it, the `moc.md` entry added/updated for it, and — if a contradiction with existing code was found and resolved — a one-line summary of what changed and why.
